# United-Airlines...

For this computer science project I will try to simulate a checking in process on one of the kiosks they use in the airport.I will now be using pygame instead of just using the python shell. This should make the experience more realistic with working buttons and options! 
There will be a beginning process to identify the flight and the person. Then it will ask for a form of identification (preferably a passport). 
The kiosk will then "scan" the passport and tell if it's a real or fake one. After this it will ask for options (extra baggage, extra legroom, business class upgrade, etc…).
Finally it will print the boarding pass and send the guest on their way. 
In order for this to work there will be a series of commands that control the display that is on the window through functional buttons. Options are given on the window to continue through the process. 
To test this kiosk I can pretend to be a passenger who wants to claim their boarding pass. 
Then I can claim I don’t know where to go.
The kiosk will then provide the necessary information to help me on my way. 
By the end of the process I should have a boarding pass.
