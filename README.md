# United-Airlines...

For this computer science project I will try to simulate a checking in process on one of the kiosks they use in the airport.I now be using pygame instead of just using the python shell. This should make the experience more realistic with working buttons and options! 
There will be a beginning process to identify the flight and the person. Then it will ask for a form of identification (preferably a passport). 
The kiosk will then scan the passport and tell if it's a real or fake one. After this it will ask for options (extra baggage, extra legroom, business class upgrade, etc…).
Finally it will print the boarding pass and send the guest on their way. 
To make this work I will use a series of “if” and “elif” statements similar to the ones we did in class on the weather → don’t forget your keys and the light example.
It will also use boolean statements asking whether if the information the kiosk has is true or false.
For example, is it true you are flying economy? It will also use some else statements which will always be true in the programming; collect your boarding pass that has printed below.
To test this kiosk I can pretend to be a passenger who wants to claim their boarding pass. 
Then I can claim I don’t know where to go.
The kiosk will then provide the necessary information to help me on my way. 
By the end of the process I should have a boarding pass.
