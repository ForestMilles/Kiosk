# United-Airlines...

For this computer science project I will try to simulate a checking in process on one of the kiosks they use in the airport. 
There will be a beginning process to identify the flight and the person. Then it will ask for a form of identification (preferably a passport). 
The kiosk will then scan the passport and tell if it's a real or fake one. After this it will ask for options (extra baggage, extra legroom, business class upgrade, etc…).
Finally it will print the boarding pass and send the guest on their way. 
To make this work I will use a series of “if” and “elif” statements similar to the ones we did in class on the weather → don’t forget your keys and the light example.
It will also use boolean statements asking whether if the information the kiosk has is true or false.
For example, is it true you are flying economy? It will also use some else statements which will always be true in the programming; collect your boarding pass that has printed below.
To test this kiosk I can pretend to be a passenger who wants to claim their boarding pass. 
Then I can claim I don’t know where to go.
The kiosk will then provide the necessary information to help me on my way. 
By the end of the process I should have a boarding pass.


First Round 
By the first  round of the project due in a couple of weeks I wold like to accomplish at least the identification - whether you check in with your passport or confirmation code and how to send someone to get help if they are too young. For example, a 13 year old trying to check in. 


Test Plan for First Round 
The user is prompted to identify themselves using one of two methods. the user can input passport or confirmation code. The program then sends the user into a different command called security. If the input of the user  is invalid the program will print "you can enter your identification through passport or your confirmation code. Please select one option."

Refelections
Overall, I think that my first Round went ok, but there are definately things that need to be improved on. After entering passport or confirmation code it gives me a syntax error. I will try to fix this before the next round. There are no changes to the big picture. 

Next Steps 
By the next round I will like to have the age identifying code finished as well as most of the security. I also hope to have the user sent to a future menu called the boarding pass menu. The user will be shown a flight number and destination and will need to verify its correct.
